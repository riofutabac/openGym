# Multi-stage: build the React app, then serve it with nginx.
# Self-hosters never need Node locally — `docker compose up` builds everything.
#
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM pins the build stage to the host's native arch even when
# cross-building for other targets (e.g. amd64 host building an arm64 image). The build
# output (static JS/CSS/HTML) is arch-independent, so there's no reason to run it under
# QEMU — and QEMU-emulated npm installs are known to corrupt esbuild/rollup's platform-
# specific native binaries, which is what breaks `vite build` with unrelated-looking
# module-resolution errors.
